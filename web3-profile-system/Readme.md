# Rust Web3 Profile System 🧑‍💻🎨

A simple console-based Rust application that models Web3 professionals such as Developers and Designers. Built as part of the Polkadot Kisumu Bootcamp to reinforce Rust concepts like structs, traits, and lifetimes.

## Features

- 🧱 Create and manage Developer and Designer profiles
- 🗣️ Introduce each professional using a shared trait
- 🧬 Compare introductions using lifetimes (bonus feature)
- ♻️ Practice safe memory handling with ownership and borrowing
- 🛠️ Clear separation of concerns using structs, impl, and traits

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Struct definitions and initialization
- Method implementation using `impl` blocks
- Shared behavior via Rust traits
- Lifetime annotations for safe reference handling
- Vector use for managing dynamic data
- Ownership and borrowing rules in action

## Prerequisites

- Rust installed (version 1.70+ recommended)
- Basic understanding of Rust's ownership model
- A terminal and text editor (e.g., VS Code)

## Installation & Running
