# Developer Dashboard â€“ Contributors Manager

This is a simple Rust program that simulates managing a list of project contributors.

## Features

- Creates a list of contributor names using `Vec<String>`
- Adds a status tag ("Active") to each contributor
- Previews the first 3 contributors
- Displays the total number of contributors
- Adds a new contributor using `.push()`
- Removes the last contributor using `.pop()`
- Uses a generic function to print any list (e.g., `Vec<String>`, `Vec<i32>`)
