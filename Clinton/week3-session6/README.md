## How to Run the Code

1. **Navigate to the project directory** (if using `cargo new`):
```bash
cd web3-profile-system

    Place the code inside the src/main.rs file.

    Run the project using Cargo:

cargo run

That’s it! The program will compile and print the developer and designer introductions, plus their names using reference return with lifetimes.

Expected Output:
Hi, I’m Alice! I’ve been coding in Rust for 3 years.
Hello, I’m Bob! I design UX/UI interfaces and have 5 years of experience.
Developer’s name (via ref): Alice
Designer’s name (via ref): Bob
