# 📝 Contributor Tracker - Rust Console App

This is a **simple Rust-based console application** for managing a list of project contributors while practicing key Rust concepts like vector manipulation, mutable iteration, slices, indexing, and generics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Create a vector of 5–7 contributor names using **`Vec<String>`**.
- ✅ Use **mutable iteration** to add a status tag like "✅ Active" to each contributor.
- ✅ Preview the **first 3 contributors** using a **slice**.
- ✅ Display the **total number of contributors** using **`.len()`**.
- ✅ Simulate adding a new contributor using **`.push()`**.
- ✅ Simulate removing the last contributor using **`.pop()`**.
- ✅ Print the contributor list **before and after changes**.
- ✅ Bonus: Write a **generic function** that can print any list type (e.g. `Vec<String>` or `Vec<i32>`).

## 🛠 Features

- Store contributor names in a vector.
- Dynamically update contributor status via mutable iteration.
- Display a preview of the top contributors using slices.
- Track the total number of contributors.
- Simulate real-time updates by adding and removing contributors.
- Bonus: Print different kinds of lists using a generic function.

## 🧠 Rust Concepts Practiced

| Concept             | Purpose                                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vectors             | Store and manage a list of contributors.                       |
| Mutable Iteration   | Update contributor names with a status tag in-place.           |
| Slices              | Efficiently preview part of the vector without copying.        |
| Indexing            | Access specific contributor names directly.                    |
| Vector Methods      | Add and remove contributors using **`.push()`** and **`.pop()`**. |
| Generics            | Write flexible functions that can handle different list types. |
