// Build a tiny “Guest Tracker” app (console-based)

// Ask for guest names and store them (practice
// ownership).

// Let parts of your code borrow guest names to
// greet them (practice borrowing).

// Ensure only one part edits guest details at a
// time (mutable borrow).

// Add a note (comment) in code about where
// scope ends and memory is freed.

// Add a function that returns a borrowed guest
// name (practice lifetimes).
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
