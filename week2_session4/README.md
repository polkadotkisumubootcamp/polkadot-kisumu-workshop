# Guest Tracker (Console App in Rust)

This is a tiny **Guest Tracker** CLI (Command Line Interface) app built in **Rust**. It helps you learn Rust ownership, borrowing, mutable references, and lifetimes through a practical example of managing guest names.

---

## Features

- Add guest names (demonstrates **ownership**).
- Greet guests (demonstrates **immutable borrowing**).
- Edit guest names safely (demonstrates **mutable borrowing**).
- Memory is managed automatically (shows **scope-based freeing**).
- View a guest by index using a function with **lifetimes**.

---

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Running the program

```
cd week2_session4
cargo run  //to build and run the application
```
